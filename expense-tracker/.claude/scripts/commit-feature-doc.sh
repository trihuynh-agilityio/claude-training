# Commits approved feature docs (intent.md, spec.md, plan.md) to the feature's integration branch,
# without touching the current checkout. Nothing here is ever pushed: build-feature pushes the branch.
#   commit-feature-doc.sh <feature-name> <feature-issue-number> <doc>...
# <doc> is a file name inside <docs_dir>/<feature-name>/ (intent.md, spec.md, plan.md).
# The branch name comes from naming.integration_branch in workflow.json. If it is missing, it is
# created from the freshly fetched <remote>/<base branch> (never a stale local copy, never main).
# The docs are copied from this checkout into a temporary worktree, committed there, and the
# worktree is removed. Prints BRANCH=, COMMIT= (or COMMIT=none when the branch already had identical files).
