# Creates or removes the throwaway worktree that verify-feature tests in. Nothing here is ever pushed.
#   verify-worktree.sh create <feature-name> <integration-branch>
#   verify-worktree.sh remove <feature-name>
# create: fetches the base branch and the integration branch from the remote in workflow.json
#   (fast-forward only), puts a local branch verify/<feature-name> at the integration tip in
#   <repo root>/.claude/worktrees/verify-<feature-name>, and, if the base is not already contained in
#   it, merges <remote>/<base> into THAT branch only, so the tree is what would land in the base.
#   A conflict aborts the merge and exits 3 (the worktree is removed).
#   Prints KEY=value lines: WORKTREE, PROJECT (the project folder inside it), INTEGRATION_HEAD,
#   DEV_HEAD (the base branch head), MERGED (yes|no).
# remove: removes the worktree and the local verify/<feature-name> branch.
# This is the only place a merge is allowed; it refuses any path outside .claude/worktrees/verify-*.
