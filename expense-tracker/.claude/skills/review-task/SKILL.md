# Review one task

The local review loop between the implementer and the UI check. It never creates a PR and never pushes.

Arguments: `<feature-name> <task-id>`, for example `over-budget-alerts T4`.

## Paths

- Project root: the folder that contains `docs/features/` (the `expense-tracker/` folder). Plan: `<project root>/docs/features/<feature-name>/plan.md`. Scripts: `<project root>/.claude/scripts/`.
- Read the task's block in the plan. Its `Branch:` gives the worktree: `<repo root>/.claude/worktrees/<branch with / replaced by ->`. Its `PR target:` is the integration branch.
- In the worktree, work from its `expense-tracker/` folder. The report is `docs/features/<feature-name>/reviews/<task-id>.md` there.

## 1. Preconditions

Stop and report if any fails:

- the worktree exists and is on the task's branch,
- `check-task.sh <task-id> <plan path>` passes,
- the task's `Verify:` command passes.

## 2. Round budget

Count the `## Round` sections already in the report (none if it does not exist). **At most 3 rounds in total**, counted across every run of this skill for the task, including re-runs after a UI check failure. If 3 are used and the last verdict is not PASS, or the code changed since a PASS, go to step 5.

## 3. Review

Call the `code-reviewer` agent with the plan path, the task id, the worktree path, and, for a later round, the last reviewed commit as the base and the earlier findings with their statuses. Get `CODE_HEAD` from `code-head.sh` in the worktree. Append to the report:

```markdown
## Round <n>
- Reviewed commit: <full CODE_HEAD hash>
- Verdict: PASS | CHANGES_REQUIRED

| # | Severity | Location | Problem | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
```

Statuses: `open`, `fixed`, `wontfix: <reason>`, `minor`. The report starts with `# Review: <task id> <task title>` and a line with the branch. Keep it small: one line per finding.

## 4. Fix loop

- **CHANGES_REQUIRED**: send **only** the blocker and major findings to the `implementer` agent in fix mode (same worktree, plan path, task id, the findings). It fixes them in a **new** commit, never an amend, re-runs `Verify:` and `check-task.sh` on the whole task diff, so the 300-line and 10-file limits are cumulative, and may answer a finding with `wontfix` and a written reason. Record each outcome in the report, then go back to step 2 for the next round.
- **PASS**: continue with step 6.

## 5. Blocked

If blocker or major findings are still open after round 3, write the final section with `Verdict: BLOCKED` (the same layout as step 6, without a PASS), show the user the open findings, and stop. No PR, no UI check.

## 6. PASS

Replace any earlier final section so the report ends with exactly one:

```markdown
## Final verdict
Verdict: PASS
Reviewed commit: <full CODE_HEAD hash>
Minor findings kept for the PR description: <list, or none>
```

Commit only the report in the worktree with `git add` and `git commit` (message `<task id>: review report`, then a blank line and the trailer `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`). Run `check-review.sh <task-id> <plan path>` and make sure it passes. Then:

- if the task has a `UI check:`, call the `ui-verifier` agent with the plan path, the task id, the worktree path and the task's lane (`solo` uses lane A),
- otherwise report "ready for PR".

Never create the PR here.

## Rules

- The reviewer and this skill never edit source code; only the implementer does, in fix mode.
- Never edit `intent.md`, `spec.md` or `plan.md`. A finding about them goes to the user.
- Never push, merge or post to GitHub.
